## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the instructions to create your bot
4. Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file

### 2. Get Your Chat ID

1. Start a conversation with your bot
2. Send any message to the bot
3. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
4. Look for the `chat.id` field in the response
5. Add this ID to your `.env` file

### 3. Optional: Set Up Amul Credentials

For cart automation functionality:

## Usage

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Available Commands

Once the bot is running, you can use these commands in Telegram:

- `/start` - Initialize the bot and show welcome message
- `/status` - Check current stock status manually
- `/start_monitoring` - Start automatic stock monitoring
- `/stop_monitoring` - Stop automatic monitoring
- `/addtocart` - Automatically add product to your Amul cart (if configured)

## How It Works

1. **Stock Monitoring**: The bot uses Puppeteer to scrape the Amul product page and check for stock indicators
2. **Notification System**: When stock becomes available, it sends a formatted message to your Telegram chat
3. **Cart Automation**: If configured, it can log into your Amul account and add the product to cart
4. **Cooldown System**: Prevents multiple notifications within a short time period
